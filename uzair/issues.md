# Issues

## UI:
* Reusability of these components to be checked

## Tab UI:
* Tab Container should be passed with properties like no of tabs and header text array

## Dropdown UI:
* The menu does not disappear when clicked outside of it's div element
* The down arrow on trigger button seems to move when clicked
* Dropdown container should be passed with properties dropdown-header text and the list items
* Pointer cursor is being shown on the right side of the dropdown trigger which is a blank space(within the Dropdown container)
